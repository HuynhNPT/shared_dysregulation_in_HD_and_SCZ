# Shared dysregulation of glial differentiation underlies disruption of glutamate signaling common to Huntington’s disease and schizophrenia

## **Abstract**
#### Huynh et al. utilized network correlation and preservation analyses to pinpoint the common dysregulatory signature between Huntington’s disease and schizophrenia. Presented as seemingly unrelated disorders, glial progenitor cells derived from affected patients in HD and SCZ both exhibited a decrease in glutamate receptor expression. This leads to an impediment in glial maturation into astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, as well as a dysregulation in synaptic signaling due to the functional loss of these supporting cells.
